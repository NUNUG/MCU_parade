# MCU Parade
This repos houses the code for showing off different MCUs and how they are programmed. There are different languages and techniques used some of the micro controllers, and so each has been broken down first by MCU followed by language/technique.

The MCUs used are:
* [Arduino](https://github.com/NUNUG/MCU_parade/Arduino/readme.md)
* [Netduino](https://github.com/NUNUG/MCU_parade/Netduino/readme.md)
* [NodeMCU](https://github.com/NUNUG/MCU_parade/NodeMCU/readme.md)
* [ESP8266](https://github.com/NUNUG/MCU_parade/ESP8266/readme.md)
* [Meadow](https://github.com/NUNUG/MCU_parade/Meadow/readme.md)
* [Digispark / ATTiny85](https://github.com/NUNUG/MCU_parade/digispark/readme.md)
* [Micro::bit](https://github.com/NUNUG/MCU_parade/micro_bit/readme.md)
